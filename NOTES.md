# Notes
New Relic offers monitoring of your webapplications, by installing a daemon on the webserver and hooking into the PHP core. This allows monitoring of specific PHP functions. This Yireo extensions extends this
behaviour so that additional Magento information can be logged.

This is not an official New Relic product, and is not endorsed by New Relic. Note that some of the functionality is only available with the New Relic Pro version: Custom metrics are only available through custom dashboards, which can only be created in the New Relic Pro subscriptions. Additionally, our Magento extension provides additional variables, which are only available with transaction tracking which again requires the Pro-version.
